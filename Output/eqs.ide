In what sense, if any, is the idea of a “Revolution of 1800” justified? (Note that Jefferson himself always considered that his election was a genuine “revolution” that ushered in the rule of the common person in American politics.)
The "Revolution of 1800" was a revolution in the sense that there was a peaceful transfer of power between two political parties. This was the first of its kind and it showed that the form of government established in the United States was working. In Jefferson's inaugural address, he addressed the federalists and democratic-republicans as different parties but under the same principles. Unlike the original European countries who had violent transfers of power, this demonstrated a "revolution" which gave people the confidence that the Constitution and democracy was working.

How did Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase transform America’s understanding of itself and its future? What were the short-term and long-term consequences of the acquisition of the Louisiana territory?
Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase transformed America's understanding of itself by waking up the extreme hunger for land within the people. Jeffersonian beliefs included a strict interpretation of the Constitution, and Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase went against his own ideals. With this in mind, he justified it as a way of expanding the argrarian cultivation. However, instead, Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase awakened technological advances that would fuel the industrial revolution rather than agrarian culture. As this occurred, people, especially Jeffersonians, realized that sticking to ideals in practice were much harder than it was to just believe in those ideals. In addition, the unexpected transition from an agrarian culture to industrial work brought forth an understanding that industry and manufacturing was where the money was at. The short term consequences of the Louisiana Purchase was that people quickly moved westward, conflicting with Indians in the area. Long term consequences was that as people moved farther into the west, the need for faster and more reliable transportation around the country was needed. Shipping raw materials from the western frontier was costly, slow, and unreliable. There would also be more conflicts over where the Louisiana territory ended, creating conflicts with Britain and Spain.

Was Jefferson’s embargo, even though unpopular, a wiser foreign policy than Madison’s blundering into war? Should a president (like Madison) ever lead the nation into war when there is deep political division over its purposes? 
Jefferson's embargo was not a wiser foreign policy than Madison's blundering into war. Jefferson's embargo greatly lowered exports and imports, damaging the overall economy, and also further damaged relations with Britain and the French. The intention of the embargo was to get Britain and France to stop beating on American ships, however, Jefferson overestimated Britain and French reliance on American exports, which greatly damaged American economy, and also put Madison in a position in which he had to fix foreign relations and the damaged American policy from Jefferson's embargo. Although Madison's declaration of war may have been a mistake, it was an outcome of Jefferson's poor embargo act. It also had beneficial outcomes for America, with a great increase in nationalism and unity within the nation.

Is it valid to call the War of 1812 “America’s worst-fought war”? Was the cause of the failure essentially military, or was it an inevitable result of the political disunity over the war’s purposes?  
It is not valid to call the War of 1812 America's worst-fought war as its important to view the results of the war. Although America suffered multiple defeats on end, America was able to hold out in the last fort and Britain retreated. The nation's nationalism was greatly bolstered and the Battle of New Orleans after the Treaty of Ghent could deem the war as an American victory. Although the US didn't exactly win the war and lost multiple battles with Britain, it was an overall beneficial war for the US.

What was significant about the strong spirit of nationalism that appeared in America from 1815 to 1824? What were its accomplishments?
The signifcance of the strong spirit of nationalism was that it created a sense of unity and a so called "era of good feelings" where people were unified in the country and had similar causes. As a result of this unity, the federalist party who had complaints stemming from the Hartford Convention were shunned and the party fell apart. This same spirit of nationalism also unified people to start many reform movements which coincided with the Second Great Awakening, such as movement for temperance, women's rights, anti-slavery, and public education. Nationalism also provided to a new sense of American identity in the form of literature and art. American art and literature moved away from European ideas, and American textbooks were used for education rather than British textbooks.

Did the Missouri Compromise effectively deal with the sectional conflict over slavery or merely shove it out of view?
The Missouri Compromise did not effectively deal with the sectional conflict over slavery, as can be seen by the conflict when Texas wanted to join the union. The Missouri Compromise offered a temporary fix to the issue of instituting Missouri into the union, however, it's clear that it just delayed the inevitable, which can be seen by the Civil War which takes place later. The Missouri Compromise also partly fueled more sectionalism, as it added a physical line to the division between free states and slave states, and thus it did not effectively deal with sectional conflict over slavery.

How does the period 1800–1812 look if viewed through Native American eyes? Could the attempt of Tecumseh and the Prophet to unite western Indians against American expansion have created a different dynamic in white-Indian relations?
The period from 1800-1812 would have looked very helpless and annoying from a Native American perspective. With US settlers constantly stealing and impeding on the Native American's land, they'd feel helpless as the land that they've owned and had memories on were taken away from them. The attempt of Tecumseh and the Prophet to unite wester Indians most likely would've resulted in harsher treatment from Americans against the Indians as a whole. Rather than the Trail of Tears, there probably would've been a Trail of Blood instead. It's evident that Americans would've looked past Native American life for westward expansion, which could be seen in the colonial days of America. Colonists in the 18th century killed and enslaved Natives for land, and the idea that Natives were inhabiting land waiting to be taken hadn't changed.

Was the Monroe Doctrine a valuable assertion of the principles of liberty and self-determination in the Americas against potential European and monarchical intrusion, or was it in effect an early manifestation of a patronizing and potentially imperialistic attitude by the United States toward Latin America?
The Monroe Doctrine was a valuable assertion in the principles of liberty and self-determination, mainly the idea of peaceful coersion. The US wanted to remain neutral and away from European affairs so it could grow and thrive without setbacks and conflict. At the time of the Monroe Doctrine, the US wouldn't be able to enforce it, and so the Monroe Doctrine was actually unintentionally enforced by the British navy who held Canada. The Monroe Doctrine wasn't looking out for the Latin America colonies, but rather was looking out for itself. By isolating the western hemisphere from European colonization, the US could feely trade with the growing latin countries in the Americas without European control and conflict.

Discuss how the nationalism of the 1810s and 1820s became the sectionalism of the 1830s and 1840s. What were the social, political, and economic reasons for these changes? 
Nationalism of the 1810s and 1820s generally unified people to have common political causes. However, with this unification, the development of industry and economy rapidly grew, and there was a lot of westward expansion. With such fast growth, issues such as slavery and women's suffrage weren't gradually addressed, and when it came to issues such as the statehood of Missouri, temporary and broken solutions such as the Missouri Compromise only provided temporary relief. Sectionalism was largely fueled by the issue of slavery and as people thrived economically, social reformation became a more progressive and sought out topic, providing more topic around slavery and oppression

To what extent is the following statement true? John Marshall created the Supreme Court as a “third” branch of government. 
John Marshall bolstered the power of the federal government, especially the power of the Supreme Court. In the case of Marbury vs. Madison, the idea of judicial review was established, which granted the Supreme Court to deem laws unconstitutional. In many cases afterwards, the idea that the federal government was more powerful than states and the such were clearly defined, and it was mainly due to the idea of judicial review. The Supreme Court had the power of ruling laws passed by the other branches unconstitutional, which was an extremely large and significant power in determining things as constituional and unconstitutional. An example of this was when the Bank of the United States was deemed constitutional. With the power of judicial review, the Supreme Court could be considered a third branch of government.

In what ways and to what extent did the Jacksonian approach to Native American issues represent a continuation of a long-standing attitude toward the American Indian? 
Jacksonian approach to relations with Native Americans depict the long standing attitude between Native Americans and the Europeans beforehand and the Americans that came before the Jeffersonian period. The indiginous people who once held onto the land that the US citizens were living on had been taken time and itme again, the with the Trail of Tears, it was done once again but through political manipulation rather than violence. There was a long standing attitude of disrespect towards American Indians, in which they weren't view as people with their owner culture, but rather people waiting to be instituted into white culture. Indian participation in the Revolutionary War where the most Indian tribes aided Britain also show the long standing conflict between the United States and American Indians. Britain also helped fuel American Indian raids and rebellion after the revolution. These events help to show that conflicting ideas, especially over the ownership of land, were long standing issues before the Jacksonian approach to Native Americans.

What made Jackson such a popular symbol of the New Democracy?  How revolutionary was Jackson’s “Revolution of 1828”? 
Jackson took advantage of the fact that the right to vote was being extended to more people, and advocated for the "common man". He traveled in person to many parts of the country to gain support, and with the "common man's" backing, he was able to make quick decisions and implement what he wanted with the large number of supporters who followed his beliefs. Jackson's "Revolution of 1828" wasn't very revolutionary as it didn't establish much change in the actual formation of the country, and rather provided temporary drawbacks to progress made in previous presidencies. This can be seen in his veto of the 2nd Bank of the United States which destroyed the US' economy, uprooting policies implemented by previous presidents, and also left Van Buren a financial crisis to fix.

How did the extension of the franchise (the right to vote) during this period create a more “democratic” American society? 
There was more representation of the general population as the right to vote extended to more people. With the right to vote extending to more people, more of what people wanted was fulfilled and the country would become more representative of what the people wanted rather than what one minority group wanted. The idea of more representation could be seen in Jackson's election, who represented the "common man". As more people were able to vote, the majority of the poorer and middle class (white) populations could vote, and thus Jackson was the more popular president over John Quincy Adams. Although more people were able to vote, a majority of the population still couldn't vote as women couldn't vote.

Why was transportation—particularly the canals and the railroads—so important in the early stages of industrialization? Would industrialization have occurred more quickly if the federal government had been unrestrained in offering financial assistance to transportation projects?
Improvements in transportation were important as it unified the South, North, and West in economy. Factories were built in the North, the South harvested raw materials, and the people expanded westward to establish more farms with different crops. Because the factories were far from the farms, it was expensive and took a lot of time to deliver raw materials to factories to be processed and manufactured. The establishment of the Turnpike Road, Erie Canal, and railroads provided safer, faster, and easier ways to travel about the country. In addition to that, the inventions of steamboats allowed even faster ways to transport material, and also ways to travel upstream rivers, and so sending goods across the country was much cheaper. Industrialization most likely would have occured at a similar pace if the federal government offered financial assisstance, as it was a clear and common goal for the citizens, and so funding wasn't a large issue.

What effects did the movement from a subsistence to a market economy have on American society, including farmers, laborers, women, free blacks, and slaves? What were the advantages and disadvantages of this change? 
The movement from a subsistence to a market economy created an interdependency between the different regions of the country. The west and south would provide raw materials to the north for production, which overall benefitted economy in all regions. Farmers strived to gain more land and harvest more cotton and other crops. The laborers would process and manufacture the raw materials in factories. Women were encapsulated into the idea of the cult of domesticity, and the idea of republican motherhood still existed. Slaves played a large role in the harvesting of cotton in the new and quickly growing textile industry. Farms and factories beneficially unified, establishing a thriving industrial market economy.
