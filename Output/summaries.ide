Ch 10: Jefferson wins the election of 1800, showing the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. Aaron Burr and Jefferson tied in the electoral vote however, so Adams appointed midnight judges after the Judiciary Act of 1801 just before Jefferson entered office. In Jefferson’s presidency, he first reduced the naturalization law to 5 years instead of 14 years, and also eliminated excise taxes established by Hamilton and Washington. Jefferson also lowered funding for the military, which fit his ideals for a friendship with other nations and to set an example of peace without fighting. Jefferson also lowered the national debt. He didn’t uproot all federal policies however, he kept the Bank of the United States and Hamilton’s assumption plan. In 1802, the Judiciary Act of 1801 was repealed, and in 1803, the Marbury vs. Madison case occurs, where chief justice John Marshall (federalist midnight judge appointed by Adams) rules that Marbury does not need to receive his commission, but at the same time, he establishes judicial review. In the same year (1803), Jefferson purchased the entire Louisiana territory from Napoleon (Louisiana Purchase), which he was conflicted on as it did not strictly say that the president could purchase land. In 1804 Jefferson was reelected as president.
