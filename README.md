# wikisearcher
Pulls basic summary definitions from wikipedia and paraphrases them multiple times through multiple google translate pass throughs to create a vocabulary list of definitions given a list of terms. 
Currently in an extremely unrefined state as I made this a while ago. Look at terms_example.txt in the load directory for an example input file.

Terminal running program must be in the directory in which all the load, output, and notfound directories are located.
Requires:
- pip install wikipedia
- pip install mtranslate
